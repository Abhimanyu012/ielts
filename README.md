# IELTS Institute — Frontend

A small, polished frontend for a fictional IELTS coaching site (React + Vite + Tailwind).

## Setup (quick)
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

3. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Design choices (short)
- Fonts: Inter for readable UI text, Montserrat for bold headings — modern, clean, and friendly.
- Hero: semantic header, clear primary CTA and a helpful secondary CTA, and a lazy-loaded image to avoid layout shift.
- Accessibility: simple semantic markup and visible focus styles so keyboard users are supported.
- Visual style: subtle accents (soft gradients, small sparkles) to make the UI feel polished without distracting from content.

That's it — simple setup and a few intentional design decisions to keep the UI modern, accessible, and easy to extend.
